IMDB  Movie  Review  Dataset  is  a  standard  dataset  for  text  classification  or  sentiment  analysis,  where each  document  (a  movie  review)  is  labeled  either  by  a  positive  label  or  by  a  negative  label.
Two  text  classification  models  using  Vanilla  RNN  and  LSTM  for  this dataset are developed. And key hyper-parameter  in  the  setup  of  models  is  the  state  dimension,  for  which the following  options:  20,  50,  100,  200,  500 are investigated.
